# Venmo-Transaction-Scraper
Scrapes statement-transactions div, outputs usable xls

I tried to access the API but wasn't getting a token. Wanted answers faster and had done similar work before, so I just copied out the html
I could add a whole selenium component to grab it from the web page, as right now it only works on html that
has been copied out and saved as an html file in the same dir as the script.

This is really just something I did today bc I needed it. I only uploaded it to get familiar with the github gui.
